# nlp-resources
A list of resources for Natural Lauguage Processing (NLP), mostly with deep learning.

## Where to start

Yoav Goldberg's book, [Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Processing-Synthesis-Lectures-Technologies/dp/1681732351/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1530395039&sr=8-1) (2017)

Chris Manning's lectures (CS224d Winter 2017) on [Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) on Youtube

Linguistic basics: Emily Bender's [Linguistic Fundamentals for Natural Language Processing: 100 Essentials from Morphology and Syntax](https://www.amazon.com/Linguistic-Fundamentals-Natural-Language-Processing/dp/1627050116/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530395715&sr=8-1&keywords=Linguistic+Fundamentals+for+Natural+Language+Processing%3A+100+Essentials+from+Morphology+and+Syntax) (2013)

## Curated lits on Github
